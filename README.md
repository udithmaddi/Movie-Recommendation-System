project:
Objective:
    This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using SQL queries.The system will generate personalized movie recommendations for users by analyzing movie ratings and user preferences, enhancing their movie-watching experience.
Dataset Overview and Preprocessing:
A dataset containing movie ratings and user information is required to build the recommendation system.The dataset may include attributes such as movie IDs, user IDs, ratings, genres, and timestamps. 
Before analyzing the data, preprocessing steps like data cleaning, handling missing values,and data normalization may be necessary to ensure accurate results.

SQL Queries for Analysis:
SQL queries will be employed to analyze the dataset to generate movie recommendations.These queries may involve aggregating ratings, calculating similarity scores between movies or users, 
and identifying top-rated or similar movies. Using SQL, the recommendation system can efficiently process large datasets and provide accurate recommendations based on user preferences.

Key Insights and Findings:
The analysis of movie ratings and user preferences will yield valuable insights.The recommendation system can identify popular movies, genres with high user ratings, and movies frequently watched together. 
These insights can help movie platforms understand user preferences, improve their movie catalog,and provide tailored recommendations, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.
